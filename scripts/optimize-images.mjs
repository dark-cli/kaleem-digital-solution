/**
 * Build-time image optimizer.
 *
 * Reads every image under TARGET_DIRS and drops responsive WebP variants
 * into `public/optimized/<same-subpath>/<name>-<width>.webp`, plus a
 * high-quality `-full.webp` at native resolution for the progressive HD
 * upgrade in BaseLayout.
 *
 * `public/optimized/` is git-ignored — this script re-creates it every
 * build. It's also outside Sveltia's `media_folder`, so the CMS media
 * picker only ever sees the source images the user actually uploaded.
 *
 * Incremental: variants are re-generated only when the source file's
 * mtime is newer than the manifest entry. Manifest keeps intrinsic
 * dimensions so the SSR helper (src/lib/image.ts) can output correct
 * width/height without re-opening every file.
 *
 * Wired to `npm run build` via package.json.
